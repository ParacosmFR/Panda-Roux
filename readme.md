### multi usage discord bot

if you want to use it, just clone the repo and create a config.json file.

```json
{
    "token": "",
    "owner_id": "",
    "clientId": "",
    "film_api_v3": "" 
}
```
film_api is the api token for themoviedb website.
clientId = is the client id of your discord bot
owner_id = your id
token = bot token of course
