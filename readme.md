### multi usage discord bot

if you want to use it, just clone the repo and create a config.json file.

```json
{
    "token": "",
    "owner_id": "",
    "clientId": "",
    "film_api_v3": "",
    "lang": "LANG_CODE" // FR_fr
}
```
film_api is the api token for themoviedb website.
clientId = is the client id of your discord bot
owner_id = your id
token = bot token of course

**For help, send me a dm**

### Commands list

see /commands folder to have a command list.
there is a lot of animations commands for the moment, but i will add moderation interactions of course.
